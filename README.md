## About 
*  Titanium is a game made in Python using the pygame library, and it is inspired by the game Frogger.

## How to play 
- Clone the repo to your computer 
- Open the file in VSCode
- Then press the play button in the game.py file
- WASD or Arrow keys allow the player to move their character
- When the player touches the water tiles, they lose one's health. In total, they have three health points. The health bar is the the top right of the screen.
- When the player loses all of their health, they are shown the game over screen.
- The player can move on top of the moving platforms to progress through the level.
- When the player gets to the end of the level and moves on top of the brown tiles, they move to the next level.
- Pressing the ESC button lets the player pause the game

## Camera 
- As the player moves, the camera follows the playerâ€™s movements
- The camera has a x and y-axis, so when the player moves side-to-side or up-and-down the camera moves too. 
- Once the player reaches the top level, the camera and player reset to the bottom of the screen for the next level.

## Power-up
- The player intersects power-up on all sides and spawns randomly
- Power-up randomly spawns without touching the water tiles
- Invisible powerup makes the player invisible and gives them extra health 
- There is also a speed power-up that increases the speed of the player.
